# Minimum Working Example of Obsidian Hover API

This is a simple [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin to demonstrate how to setup your custom [Page Preview](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Page+preview).

Hover over an inline title. Then, a popover preview will appear and the active note will displayed in it.
